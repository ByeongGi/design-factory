## Project Overview

디자인 팩토리는 디자인 시안에 따라 디자인 시스템의 기본 템플릿을 구성하는 프로젝트입니다.

**Goal**: Create a foundational design system template based on provided design specifications.

## Project Status

This is a new project currently in the initial setup phase. The codebase structure and tooling will be established based on the design system requirements.

## Architecture Notes

As this is a design system project, consider the following architectural patterns:

- **Component-First**: Design systems are built around reusable components
- **Token-Based**: Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) should be centralized and themeable
- **Documentation-Driven**: Components need clear documentation and examples
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance should be built in from the start

## Development Workflow

Commands will be added here once the project tooling is configured (e.g., build commands, test runners, linting, Storybook/documentation tools).

## Design System Structure

Typical organization for a design system includes:
- Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, etc.)
- Primitive components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
- Composite components (forms, cards, etc.)
- Layout components (grid, stack, etc.)
- Utilities and hooks
- Theme configuration

The specific structure will be determined based on the provided design specifications.
